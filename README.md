Okay, so I just got out of watching Gap, and... what even was that? I mean, I left the theater feeling like my brain got caught in a windstorm of “what the hell did I just watch?” Seriously, it’s like the writers decided to throw every emotion ever into a blender and forgot to put the lid on.

Right off the bat, the movie throws this weird tension at you—like you stepped on your cat's tail, and now you’re too scared to check if it’s okay. You can almost feel the director smirking behind his overpriced coffee, leaving all these dangling threads just because he can. Do they resolve anything? Who knows! Probably a fun game of “spot the actual plot” in there somewhere.

> Anyway, there’s this one scene where the main guy, let’s call him... umm, Joe because I forgot his actual name—classic me—leans against a doorway like it’s some profound metaphor. I mean sure, doorways are cool and all, but can we talk about how he was looking at the dust motes like they held the secrets of life? Maybe I missed something, but come on. Metaphors need a license I swear!

The music was another beast entirely. It’s like they hired a DJ whose day job is chaos coordinator.” One minute it’s eerily quiet, then BAM! In comes a bass drop so intense, I thought I was losing my soul to the orchestra. Are they trying to signal a twist or just frantically grab my attention before I contemplate downloading it later just to make sense of it? Who knows.

Oh! And the visuals! Sometimes it was all “hey, look at this artsy shot of rain on a window,” other times just a camera chase scene that had me reaching for a seasickness bag. I actually found myself wondering if the editor was having a bit of a laugh, letting a cat roll across the keyboard during the final cut.

function unpredictablePlot() { var endings = []; while (true) { endings.push(Math.random() > 0.5 ? resolved : more confusion); if (endings.length > 10) break; } return endings; }

Overall, Gap felt like an abstract painting where the lines between genius and what am I looking at? blur perfectly. I’m not sure if it was good or a two-hour think-piece… just existing. Maybe after I watch it again, I'll figure it out. Or maybe it’s one of those films that leaves you kinda lost because that’s the point. So, if you're into puzzles that don’t exactly have all the pieces, go watch it. Just remember to pack a little patience and a whole lot of “go with the flow.”
